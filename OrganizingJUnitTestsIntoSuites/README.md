Step 4: Run the Master Suite
TestSuite2 acts as a master suite, including both individual test cases and another suite (TestSuite1), which itself contains multiple test cases. Running TestSuite2 will execute all tests from TestCase1, TestCase2, and TestCase3.




There must be at least two unit test cases for each requirement âˆ’ one positive test and one negative test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement must have at least two test cases as positive and negative.
